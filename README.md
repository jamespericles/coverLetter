# Cover Letter Generator

This is an incredibly simple script to generate a new cover letter. I'm finding that as I job hunt, there are enough companies that require a cover letter to warrant a handy little tool such as this.

### Usage

First execute `npm i` to install all necessary dependencies. Afterwhich, run `node index.js` from the root directory. 

The following is only entirely based on the cover letter template, and is written with my template in mind. I encourage anyone interested to write their own and update the questions accordingly.
You will be prompted with two questions, the name of the company and the position you are applying for. After which, a markdown file is generated in a subdirectory titled `output`. If `output` doesn't exist, one will be created.
